App's Arquitecture
Client Side

- I've desided to use Material-UI not only with the sole objetive to learn but also becasue the librry has a nice community and is well maintained
- Styled-components as styling system becasue is the best option available right now.
- Next.js, Reactjs with hooks and Redux as JS stack
